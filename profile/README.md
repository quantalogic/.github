AI-Powered Agent Platform

QuantaLogic is a  ReAct (Reasoning & Action) framework  for building advanced AI agents. 

It seamlessly integrates large language models (LLMs) with a robust tool system, enabling agents to understand, reason about, and execute complex tasks through natural language interaction.

The `cli` version include coding capabilities comparable to Aider.

## Why QuantaLogic?

We created [QuantaLogic](https://www.quantalogic.app) because we saw a significant gap between the advanced AI models developed by companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek and their practical implementation in everyday business processes. 

> Our mission is to bridge this gap, making the power of generative AI accessible and actionable for businesses of all sizes.
